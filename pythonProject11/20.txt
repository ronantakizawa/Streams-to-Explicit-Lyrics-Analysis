[chorus: justin bieber]
picture perfect, you don't need no filter
gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer
shower you with all my attention
yeah, these are my only intentions
stay in the kitchen cookin' up, got your own bread
heart full of equity, you're an asset
make sure that you don't need no mentions
yeah, these are my only intentions

[verse 1: justin bieber]
shout-out to your mom and dad for makin' you
standin' ovation, they did a great job raisin' you
when i create, you're my muse
that kind of smile that makes the news
can't nobody throw shade on your name in these streets
triple threat, you a boss, you a bae, you a beast
you make it easy to choose
you got a mean touch, i can't refuse (no, i can't refuse it)

[chorus: justin bieber]
picture perfect, you don't need no filter
gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer
shower you with all my attention
yeah, these are my only intentions
stay in the kitchen cookin' up, got your own bread
heart full of equity, you're an asset
make sure that you don't need no mentions
yeah, these are my only intentions
[verse 2: justin bieber]
already passed, you don't need no approval
good everywhere, don't worry 'bout no refusal
second to none, you got the upper hand now
don't need a sponsor, nope, you're the brand now
you're my rock, my colorado
got that ring, just like toronto
love you now, a little more tomorrow
this how i feel, act like you know that you are

[chorus: justin bieber & quavo]

[verse 3: quavo]

it's fifty-fifty percentage (fifty), attention, we need commitment (oh)
we gotta both admit it (both), it's funny, we both listen (both)
it's a blessing (blessing) 'cause we both get it (both)
you the best thing (woo), and i don't need a witness (best thing)
i'ma find me a ring and pray it's perfect fitted (perfect, perfect, perfect)
[chorus: justin bieber]
