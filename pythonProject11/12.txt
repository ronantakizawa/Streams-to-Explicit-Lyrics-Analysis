[intro]
i don't really wanna go
i don't really wanna stay
but i really hope and pray
can we get it together?
get it together
mustard on the beat, ho

[chorus: roddy ricch]
i put the new forgis on the jeep
i trap until the bloody bottoms is underneath
'cause all my niggas got it out the streets
i keep a hundred racks inside my jeans
i remember hittin' the mall with the whole team
now a nigga can't answer calls 'cause i'm ballin'
i was wakin' up, gettin' racks in the morning
i was broke, now i'm rich, these niggas salty

[verse 1: roddy ricch]
all this designer on my body got me drip, drip, ayy
straight up out the yajects, i'm a big crip
if i got a pint of lean, i'ma sip, sip
i run the racks up with my queen like london and nip
but i got rich on all these niggas, i didn't forget, back
i had to go through the struggle, i didn't forget that
i hopped inside of the maybach and now i can sit back
these bitches know me now 'cause i got them big racks
'cause i'm gettin' money now, i know you heard that
young nigga on the corner, bitch, i had to serve crack
uncle fronted me some p's, had to get them birds back
we came up on dirty money, i gave it a birdbath
cut off the brain and i give my bitch a new coupe
either you from the yah gang or you're suwoop
got a new orleans bitch and man, that pussy voodoo
and i'm that nigga now, who knew?
[chorus: roddy ricch]
i put the new forgis on the jeep
i trap until the bloody bottoms is underneath
'cause all my niggas got it out the streets
i keep a hundred racks inside my jeans
i remember hittin' the mall with the whole team
now a nigga can't answer calls 'cause i'm ballin'
i was wakin' up, gettin' racks in the morning
i was broke, now i'm rich, these niggas salty

[verse 2: roddy ricch]
i been wakin' up to get the money, woah, woah
got a bad bitch, her ass tatted, woah, woah
givenchy to my toes, two twins, i'm fucking 'em both
i put her in a new ap, the water like a boat
i was down bad on my dick, where was you niggas at?
i know you turned your back on me just to get some racks
i seen you swerve back, 'cause i'm in the black 'bach
new diamonds on me, fuck a flash, this ain't snapchat
'cause i been gettin' paid
yellow diamonds on me look like lemonade
got my baby mama that new bentayga
tryna get the dough, joe, like a sensei, yeah
rolls royce umbrellas when i'm in the rain
i just mind my business
i got brothers that did the time, i ain't kiddin'
all these rappers just talk about it, i live it
goin' up, i ain't got no sky limit, yeah, yeah, yeah
[chorus: roddy ricch]
i put the new forgis on the jeep
i trap until the bloody bottoms is underneath
'cause all my niggas got it out the streets
i keep a hundred racks inside my jeans
i remember hittin' the mall with the whole team
now a nigga can't answer calls 'cause i'm ballin'
i was wakin' up, gettin' racks in the morning
i was broke, now i'm rich, these niggas salty

[outro: roddy ricch]
