Falling

[intro]
oh
ooh, ooh

[chorus]
my last made me feel like i would never try again
but when i saw you, i felt something i never felt
come closer, i'll give you all my love
if you treat me right, baby, i'll give you everything
my last made me feel like i would never try again
but when i saw you, i felt something i never felt
come closer, i'll give you all my love
if you treat me right, baby, i'll give you everything

[verse]
talk to me, i need to hear you need me like i need ya
fall for me, i wanna know you feel how i feel for you, love
before you, baby, i was numb, drown out pain by pourin' up
speedin' fast on the run, never wanna get caught up
now you're the one that i'm callin'
swore i thought i'd never fall again, don't think i'm just talkin'
i think i might go all in, no exceptions, girl, i need ya

[bridge]
feeling like i'm out of my mind, 'cause i can't get enough
only one that i give my time, 'cause i got eyes for ya
might make an exception for ya, 'cause i been feelin' ya
think i might be out of my mind, i think that you're the one
[chorus]
my last made me feel like i would never try again
but when i saw you, i felt something i never felt
come closer, i'll give you all my love
if you treat me right, baby, i'll give you everything
my last made me feel like i would never try again
but when i saw you, i felt something i never felt
come closer, i'll give you all my love
if you treat me right, baby, i'll give you everything

[outro]
will never give my all again
'cause i'm sick of falling down
when i open up and give my trust
they find a way to break it down
break down
tear me up inside
when you break me down
